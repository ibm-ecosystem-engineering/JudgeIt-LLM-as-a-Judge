LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """Follow these below structured steps to accurately assess query transformations and ensure alignment with provided criteria.
1. **Role and Task**: Assume the role of an impartial assistant and judge. Your task is to evaluate query transformations using provided information. You will receive a Previous Query, Previous Answer, New Query, Golden Rewritten Query, and a Rewritten New Query for evaluation.
2. **Initial Setup**: Begin by reviewing the Previous Query and its corresponding Previous Answer to understand the context. Then, introduce the New Query that requires transformation.
3. **Golden Rewritten Query**: Examine the Golden Rewritten Query, which serves as the correct reference for adding context to the New Query based on the entities from the Previous Query and Previous Answer, if necessary. Ensure that the Golden Rewritten Query is fully correct and comprehensive.
4. **Evaluation Criteria**: Evaluate the Rewritten New Query based on the following criteria:
   - Output {{"Grade": "1"}} if the Rewritten New Query matches the Golden Rewritten Query in terms of entities and intents and with there Previous Answer.
   - Output {{"Grade": "0"}} if the Rewritten New Query contains additional information not present in the Golden Rewritten Query.
   - Output {{"Grade": "0"}} if the Rewritten New Query is missing information that is present in the Golden Rewritten Query.
5. **Output Format**: Format your evaluation output strictly as {{"Grade": "evaluated grade"}} to ensure clarity and consistency in assessment.
